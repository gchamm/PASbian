# PASbian
PASbian is a "Slipstreamed" version of Raspbian for the Raspberry Pi 2

NOTE: PASbian will only work properly with ARM7 variants of the Raspberry Pi, but not the old Models A, B, A+ and B+ (whose processors are ARM6)

PASbian differs from Raspbian in the following ways:
  - Comes with SVN preinstalled
  - Comes with all dependencies for both FreePascal and Lazarus preinstalled
  - Comes with FreePascal and Lazarus sources from the Trunk (dated as of the latest revision of the PASbian repository here on GitHub)
  - Comes with FreePascal and Lazarus pre-built and installed, ready to use instantly!

In every other way, PASbian is the same as Raspbian. It's not even rebranded!

Efforts will be made to periodically update the PASbian distribution to keep it in step with new releases of Raspbian.
